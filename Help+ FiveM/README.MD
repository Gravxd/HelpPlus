This is my first resource so if you think i need to improve on anything let me know on Discord: Ryan K#9910

This resource was helped by a YouTuber Called "Jeva" he does FiveM tutorials and i learned how to script lua by watcthing him.

To install just drag the Help+ file to your resources folder and go to server.cfg and ensure or start Help+. Depending if you have ensure or start.

You can configure the settings by going into help+.lua and changing your discord, teamspeak or website. You can change them to your liking and change the colour on where it says "--Here you can change the colour". This is quite self explanatory and the instructions and what to edit are on the help+.lua file but cancelled out!

Anyway thanks for using my resource and have a Good day!
